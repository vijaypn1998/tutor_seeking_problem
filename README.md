Seeking Tutor Problem
The computer science department runs a mentoring center (csmc) to help undergraduate
students with their programming assignments. The lab has a coordinator and several
tutors to assist the students. The waiting area of the center has several chairs. Initially, all
the chairs are empty. The coordinator is waiting for the students to arrive. The tutors are
either waiting for the coordinator to notify that there are students waiting or they are
busy tutoring. The tutoring area is separate from the waiting area.
A student while programming for their project, decides to go to csmc to get help from a
tutor. After arriving at the center, the student sits in an empty chair in the waiting area
and waits to be called for tutoring. If no chairs are available, the student will go back to
programming and come back to the center later. Once a student arrives, the coordinator
queues the student based on the student’s priority (details on the priority discussed
below), and then the coordinator notifies an idle tutor. A tutor, once woken up, finds the
student with the highest priority and begins tutoring. A tutor after helping a student, waits
for the next student. A student, after receiving help from a tutor goes back to
programming.
The priority of a student is based on the number of times the student has taken help from
a tutor. A student visiting the center for the first time gets the highest priority. In general,
a student visiting to take help for the ith time has a priority higher than the priority of the
student visiting to take help for the kth time for any k > i. If two students have the same
priority, then the student who came first has a higher priority.
Using POSIX threads, mutex locks, and semaphores implement a solution that
synchronizes the activities of the coordinator, tutors, and the students. Some hints to
implement this project are provided later in the description.
The total number of students, the number of tutors, the number of chairs, and the number
of times a student seeks a tutor’s help are passed as command line arguments as shown
below (csmc is the name of the executable):
csmc #students #tutors #chairs #help
csmc 10 3 4 5
csmc 2000 10 20 4
Once a student thread takes the required number of helps from the tutors, it should
terminate. Once all the student threads are terminated, the tutor threads, the coordinator
thread, and the main program should be terminated.
Your program should work for any number of students, tutors, chairs and help sought.
Allocate memory for data structures dynamically based on the input parameter(s).
Note, pthread_create() may throw error if you try to create a large number of threads.
Check the file ~/.bashrc. There may be line 'ulimit -u 100' in it. This limits you from
creating more than 100 threads. Modify the line to set ulimit to 2100.
Output
Your program must output the following at appropriate times.
Output of a student thread (x and y are ids):
S: Student x takes a seat. Empty chairs = <# of empty chairs
after student x took a seat>.
S: Student x found no empty chair. Will try again later.
S: Student x received help from Tutor y.
Output of the coordinator threads (x is the id, and p is the priority):
C: Student x with priority p added to the queue. Waiting
students now = <# students waiting>. Total requests = <total #
requests (notifications sent) by students for tutoring so far>
Output of a tutor thread after tutoring a student (x and y are ids):
T: Student x tutored by Tutor y. Students tutored now = <#
students receiving help now>. Total sessions tutored = <total
number of tutoring sessions completed so far by all the tutors>
Your program should not output anything else. You may use several printf statements for
debugging. Disable them before you submit the code. You will lose one point for every
line of unspecified output. If you are testing your program with a large number of threads,
redirect the output to a file. It will save time for you. Also, print all error messages on
stderr. This will avoid the error message redirection along with the output.
Implementation Hints
Using Pthreads, begin by creating n students and m tutors as separate threads. (n and m
are arguments to the program.) The coordinator will run as a separate thread. Student
threads will alternate between programming for a period and seeking help from the tutor.
If a tutor is available, they will obtain help. Otherwise, they will either sit in a chair in the
waiting area or if no chairs are available, resume programming and seek help later.
When a student arrives and finds an empty chair, the student must notify the coordinator
using a semaphore. The coordinator then must queue the student according to the
student’s priority. How does the coordinator know which student has arrived? How does
the tutor find the student with the highest priority? (Clue: You need two shared data
structures here. Also, you just need a simple data structure for implementing priority.)
When a tutor is free (either initially or after helping a student), the tutor must wait for the
coordinator to notify of a waiting student (use another semaphore). A tutor should then
wake up the student with highest priority. A tutor cannot wake up any student.
Simulate the programming part of a student thread by sleeping for a random amount of
time up to 2 ms. For the tutoring part, make both the student and the tutor thread sleep
for 0.2 ms.
For details on how to use pthreads, synchronization primitives mutex and semaphores see
man pages. For a more detailed tutorial on Pthreads and Semaphores, see
